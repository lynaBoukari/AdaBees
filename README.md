"Let's Gym" is a self trainer solution that aims to provide you a real Gym with professional coach environment at your home. It has been created in order to solve a problematic using LG devices. Our solution is based on the body tracking principle, linked in the other side, by the ThinQ app extension in which we added our new feature and with the Web App designed and implemented exclusivly for the OS of LG devices, more precisely for "LG smart TV" and the new "Stand By Me" device. 
<sub><sup> Let's Gym came out from <b>L</b>..<b>G</b></sup></sub>

## Coding Process and Techs
This project was developped during a weekend hackathon (IWD Algiers), as a team, each one got a responsability starting by brainstorming and making goal get clearer to prototyping using Figma, mobile dev using Kotlin to ensure the performance and match the ThinQ main app, passing by the LG device's App which is more a web app simulated on WebOs to bring closer the LG environment and finally the body tracking model tested and developpped from scratch during the hackathon using Python.
